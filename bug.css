The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:  .container { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; }  .item { width: 100px; }  This code intends to distribute three '.item' elements evenly within the '.container'. However, if the total width of the '.item' elements exceeds the width of the '.container', some browsers might not handle the 'space-between' distribution correctly, leading to overlapping or unexpected spacing.
